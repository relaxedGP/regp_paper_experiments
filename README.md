## Requirements

### Installation for Python

Use Python>=3.8.

```
## Create & activate virtual environnement
python3 -m venv regp
source ./regp/bin/activate

## Alternative: using conda
# conda create --prefix `pwd`/regp python=3.11
# source activate ./regp

## Install torch
pip3 install torch

## Install gpmp fork
git clone -b regp_paper_experiments https://github.com/relaxedGP/gpmp.git
pip3 install -e gpmp

## Install gpmp-contrib fork
git clone -b regp_paper_experiments https://github.com/relaxedGP/gpmp-contrib.git
pip3 install -e gpmp-contrib
```

### Reproducing the benchmarks

The three benchmarks of the article can be run using the script `run/bench.py`.
The folder `results` must be created for storage.

#### Expected Improvement benchmark

The EGO algorithm and the three EGO-R variants introduced in the article can be run using the script `run/bench.py`.
To run one repetition of the *concentration* heuristic on the *Goldstein-Price* function, one can use
```
PYTHONPATH=utils SMC_METHOD=restart PROBLEM=goldsteinprice ALGO=EI STRATEGY=Concentration python3 -u run/bench.py
```
The two other reGP variants are run by setting `STRATEGY=Constant` and `STRATEGY=Spatial`.
The traditional EGO algorithm is run by setting `STRATEGY=None`.

The file `optim_cases.txt` details the keywords for the other test functions from the article.

#### Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) benchmark

For the UCB algorithm with a 10\%-quantile, the corresponding command is
```
PYTHONPATH=utils SMC_METHOD=subset problem=goldsteinprice ALGO=UCB10 STRATEGY=Concentration python3 -u run/bench.py
```
The same command can be used for the other keywords from the file `optim_cases.txt`. 
Other quantile levels can be used. For instance, the argument `ALGO=UCB1` stands for the UCB algorithm with a 1\% quantile.

#### Straddle benchmark

The straddle benchmark can be reproduced similarly. For the `c6` test function, run
```
PYTHONPATH=utils PROBLEM=c6 ALGO=straddle STRATEGY=Concentration SMC_METHOD=subset python3 -u run/bench.py
```
Use the same command for the `c67` test function.
The argument `PROBLEM=goldsteinprice-1000` can be used to run the straddle heuristic on the Goldstein-Price function with the threshold $`s = 1000`$.
The corresponding argument is `PROBLEM=goldstein_price_log-6.90775` for the log version.
The straddle heuristic can be run with other threshold values for the Goldstein-Price function and its log version.

#### Noisy optimization experiments

Noisy optimization experiments can also be run. Noisy models are selected by setting `STRATEGY=None-Noisy` (GPs) or
`STRATEGY=Spatial-Noisy` (two-stage reGP algorithm tested in the article). Simulated Gaussian noise is added to the test
functions. For instance, adding Gaussian noise with variance~$10^4$ to the Goldstein-Price function is made
by setting `PROBLEM=noisy-goldsteinprice-10000.0`. Running the experiments from the article is made by using
```
PYTHONPATH=utils PROBLEM=noisy-goldsteinprice-10000.0 ALGO=UCB10 STRATEGY=Spatial-Noisy SMC_METHOD=subset python3 -u run/bench.py
```
and
```
PYTHONPATH=utils PROBLEM=noisy-goldstein_price_log-9.0 ALGO=UCB10 STRATEGY=Spatial-Noisy SMC_METHOD=subset python3 -u run/bench.py
```

##### Launching multiple repetitions using SLURM

The previous commands can be used to launch a single repetition of sequential design-of-experiments strategies.
Several repetitions can be launched in parallel using SLURM.
For instance, one can launch 100 repetitions of EGO-R with the concentration heuristic on the Goldstein-Price function
using
```
bash run_method.sh results goldsteinprice Concentration 100 EI
```
The script `run_allmethods.sh` can be used to launch "None", "Concentration", "Constant", and "Spatial" in parallel:
```
bash run_allmethods.sh goldsteinprice 100 EI
```
Note that these bash scripts use the `python3` command.

The script `run_allnoisymethods.sh` can be used to launch "None-Noisy" and "Spatial-Noisy" in parallel:
```
bash run_allnoisymethods.sh noisy-goldsteinprice-10000.0 100 UCB10
```

### Plotting the results

The `.pgf` figures showing the results of the benchmarks can be reproduced using the scripts in `utils/analysis`.
Assume the results are stored in the `results` folder at the root of the repos and
`figures_path` is the folder where the `.pgf` files should be stored.
For EI and UCB, one can use
```
cd utils/analysis
python3 -u plot_optim.py EI ../../results figures_path
```
For the straddle heuristic, one can run
```
cd utils/analysis
python3 -u plot_levelset.py c6 ../../results figures_path
```
Run the same command for the other test functions.
